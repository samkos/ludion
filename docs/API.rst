Ludion's API
============


At this stage, *Ludion* API is still under development. For now, its public
API is only available as Unix commands and NodeJS, Python and Dart
languages are expected to be supported in the near future. 

The following Unix commands are available:

- **registerService**, to register a new service,
- **getService**, to get details about a service already deployed,
- **updateService**, to update values relative to a service expected to
  be published on **Ludion**'s dashboard,
- **listServices**, to list all available services,
- **setServiceTrigger**, to establish a graphical widget in the
  Ludion's dashboard in the view related to the current service and
  triggers its activation to an action executed immediately in the
  corresponding job
